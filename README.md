# Liars-Registry-API
A database of demonstrable falsehoods told by public figures.

Records who said what, when, on what subject, why, and how we know it was not just false but deceitful.

Intended users: Journalists, researchers, anyone with an enthusiasm for lowering public trust.

## Resources

How you'll work together
